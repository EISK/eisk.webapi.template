Test Strategy

Api Controller Tests
    * In-memory web tests
    * All http codes tests only (200, 404)
    * Can be used with build server
Domain Service Tests
    * In-memory tests (default): for smaller projects (assumes empty database in each test case)
    * Unit tests: for large projects
    * Tests only the business rules
    * Can be used with build server
Data Service Tests:
    * SQL Server integration tests (not included in solution by default)
    * Tests all database queries/operations
    * To be used in post-deployment (in dev/UAT environment)
    * To be used with empty sql server with test seed data (in dev envrionment)
    * To be used with existing sql server with test seed data (in UAT envrionment) - smoke tests only

System Tests:
    * Health check 
        ** to be tested locally, dev, prod
        ** Includes db configuration tests
        ** Any other external dependencies, like email server, blob storage
        ** Can inlcude asp.net core feature, azure feature

Reasons to consider testing base integration tests

Sql Server (in-memory)
- To verify if the ORM data model is not breaking (unsupported binding)
- To verify if the ORM is working as expected (may not be needed if ORM documentation is available)

Sql Server (generated from ORM)
- To verify if the ORM data model is not breaking (unsupported binding)
- To verify if the ORM is working as expected (may not be needed if ORM documentation is available)
- To verify if the valid test data working (column size)

Sql Server (live environment)
- To check if the schema is same (can be achieved via schema comparison tool)
- To check if the functionality is working as expected even if schema and database version is not identical
