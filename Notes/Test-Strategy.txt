Test Strategy

Api Controller Tests
    * In-memory web tests
    * All http codes tests only (200, 404)
    * Can be used with build server
Domain Service Tests
    * In-memory tests (default): for smaller projects (assumes empty database in each test case)
    * Unit tests: for large projects
    * Tests only the business rules
    * Can be used with build server
Data Service Tests:
    * SQL Server integration tests (not included in solution by default)
    * Tests all database queries/operations
    * To be used in post-deployment (in dev/UAT environment)
    * To be used with empty sql server with test seed data (in dev envrionment)
    * To be used with existing sql server with test seed data (in UAT envrionment) - smoke tests only
