Reasons to consider testing base integration tests

Sql Server (in-memory)
- To verify if the ORM data model is not breaking (unsupported binding)
- To verify if the ORM is working as expected (may not be needed if ORM documentation is available)

Sql Server (generated from ORM)
- To verify if the ORM data model is not breaking (unsupported binding)
- To verify if the ORM is working as expected (may not be needed if ORM documentation is available)
- To verify if the valid test data working (column size)

Sql Server (live environment)
- To check if the schema is same (can be achieved via schema comparison tool)
- To check if the functionality is working as expected even if schema and database version is not identical
